# simple-kanban-js

I'm learning web development and I had the idea to create a small kanban board.

It's very incomplete at the moment, I just coded this.

There are some obvious things missing, but I think until I finish it it's also a great starter template to learn some js.

## Features

- uses Bootstrap 5
- drag and drop todos
- saves todos in localStorage
- create todos
